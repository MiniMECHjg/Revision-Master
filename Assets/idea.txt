---For Subject---
Should have Subject at the top

Second line should have the name of the subject

Third line should have the value of if there is sub-topic or not

Every question should have ` at the start unless it is not a topic.
If it does not have ` there is a new sub-topic with that name
This works by creating a temp variable holding the whole line in the script
If the first value is ` it knows that it needs to delete it 

Each question should be seperated by ¬
Every new thing should be split by a new line this creates a list of each line

Hold a variable for the count of sub-topics so you add a subtopic then increment.
This means you can then add the questions to the sub-topics

---For new sub-topic---
Should have SubTopic at the top

Second Line should have the name of the subject

The rest is just the questions
Each new line symbolises a new question
Each important variable of the questions is split by ¬ or `
